          You know those days you don't want to grind? Those days you come with
          any little excuse to get out of the work? Those are the days you have
          to grind the hardest. Stop listening to that weak voice that tells you
          that you need to take a break. you're doing too much. More times than
          not, that voice is lying to you. Push through that discomfort and find
          new levels of yourself. You'd be amazed at what you're capable of if
          you go all out and push yourself to the limits. Think about how great
          you'll feel at the end of the day, knowing you gave it your all.
